 Prototyping an adventure-based rpg with auto chess elements

The starting point for this idea is:
- A 3/4 top down pixel art adventure game where the central combat mechanic is auto chess on an isometric board.
- The player collects unique "pieces" that they can use in battle to set up their board to fight enemy boards.
- These pieces are collected throughout the world in different nooks and crannies, hopefully creating a strong and rewarding sense of exploration.
- Each piece corresponds to a different auto chess unit that has unique attack patterns, skills, and movement creating interesting strategic decisions within party composition.
- Leveling up is character-wide to facilitate the use of many different pieces instead of sticking to a core set a la pokemon.
- Leveling up is more of a passive activity than an active one; the player should first consider exploring for pieces that represent their enemies weaknesses before grinding for experience.
- That said, if the player stumbles onto a later-game enemy at a low level, it should be almost impossible to win.
- Mid-battle interaction is a design space that warrants consideration, but I'm focused on the nuts and bolts of the design in this big picture.
- Bosses boards act a little bit differently to minor enemies, where the boss has a "king" unit signified with some design element that when it dies, the boss is killed no matter the other pieces remaining a la chess.
- Clover is a name I thought of randomly and has no significance whatsoever.
