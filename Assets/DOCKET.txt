IDEAS:

	SMALL QUESTIONS
	- Collectible board skins? idk
	
	BIG QUESTIONS
	- How do I make the player feel like they're doing something during an auto chess battle?
		> In Candy Box 1 & 2, the gameplay has significant similarities to auto chess in the sense that your character will automatically fight without you pressing anything,
		> but in order to make progress, you have to strategically use potions and other in-battle items at the right time to overcome your opponents. Could this work?
